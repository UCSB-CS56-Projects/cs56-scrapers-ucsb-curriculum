a. This is a prototype for an object for screen scraping the Curriculum Search page.
b. As a student I can use this Gold scraper too look up information about the courses offered at UCSB.
c. You can run the scraper through the terminal to look up courses, but the GUI seems to not exist yet. 
d. Make it so searches can be more specific than just the department. Have the ability to compare the times of classes to mock up a schedule. Write a function that takes in a requirement and displays the classes that fufill that requirement. A function that allows you to sort through classes by the days and time they are offered.
e. The read me seems to be in a good place. It was pretty clear about what the goal of the project was, but not as much on where exactly on the path to the final goal the code is.
f. The build.xml has descriptions for all targets, and does not seem to have old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed.
g. The issues are described clearly, and according to their estimates there is more than 1000 points of fixes to makes.
h. We had troubles getting the GUI to work, but it was unclear if it was a problem with my machine or the code.
i. There is a lot of code to sift through, but the names of the classes make it easy to see what each class does. When looking at the classes it is clear how there are different objects for lectures and sections. There is also a class that allows you to look through the UCSB curriculum. The methods are also clear as to their purpose. There does not seem to be many large or hard to follow methods, just some unfamiliar sintax. I think the most important piece of information to convey to a person looking at the code for the first time is how the lecture, section, and search curriculum class interact.
j. The test coverage seems pretty comprehensive. There are JUnit tests, but it somewhat unclear as to how many of these tests the code is actually passing and how mmany it is actually failing. There seems to be an oppertunity to improve the feedback given by the tests.
